                <p>Founded in 2010, LuxStay Hotels began with a simple vision: to create a hotel experience that combines luxury, comfort, and authentic local experiences. What started as a single boutique hotel in Manhattan has grown into a collection of premium properties across the globe.</p>
                <p>Our journey has been driven by a passion for hospitality and a commitment to excellence. We believe that a great hotel stay is more than just a comfortable bed â€“ it's about creating memories that last a lifetime.</p>

                <p>At LuxStay, we're guided by three core principles:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Exceptional Service</strong> - We go above and beyond to anticipate and fulfill our guests' needs.</li>
                  <li><strong>Authentic Experiences</strong> - Each of our properties offers a genuine connection to its location and culture.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sustainability</strong> - We're committed to responsible tourism and minimizing our environmental footprint.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We believe that luxury doesn't have to come at the expense of sustainability, and we're continuously working to implement eco-friendly practices across all our properties.</p>
